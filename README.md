## How to run
### Dependencies
#### You need to download this if you don't have java
1. Java 8 - specifically jdk1.8.0_131 (download for your OS - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html)
#### No need to download, I already committed these to the repo in lib/
2. json-simple-1.1.1.jar
3. junit-4.12.jar
4. hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

### Netbeans
1. Load this repo into Netbeans - NewProject->Java Project with Existing Resources->Make sure "Project Folder" is this repo name->Existing Sources, add src/ and test/
2. You may need to resolve hamcrest
3. RightClick Project->Properties->Libraries->Add JAR/Folder->lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar
4. RightClick BackendDeveloperTakeHome.java->Run File
5. RightClick ProjectName->Test

### Commandline
1. Obviously `git clone <repo>` and `cd <repo>`
2. `mkdir classes`
#### Windows
##### Run program
compile: `javac -d "classes" -cp lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar src/**/*.java src/trueaccord/**/*.java`\
run: `java -cp "classes;lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar" trueaccord/BackendDeveloperTakeHome`
##### Run tests
compile: `javac -d "classes" -cp "lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar;lib/junit-4.12.jar" src/**/*.java src/trueaccord/**/*.java test/**/*.java test/trueaccord/**/*.java`\
run: `java -cp "classes;lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar;lib/junit-4.12.jar;lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore trueaccord.AdminToolTest trueaccord.DebtInfoTest trueaccord.DebtTest trueaccord.PaymentPlanTest trueaccord.PaymentTest trueaccord.util.EndpointConsumerTest`

#### Mac/linux (only diff is replacing classpath "-cp" to use ':' instead of ';')
##### Run program
compile: `javac -d "classes" -cp lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar src/**/*.java src/trueaccord/**/*.java`\
run: `java -cp "classes:lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar" trueaccord/BackendDeveloperTakeHome`
##### Run tests
compile: `javac -d "classes" -cp "lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:lib/junit-4.12.jar" src/**/*.java src/trueaccord/**/*.java test/**/*.java test/trueaccord/**/*.java`\
run: `java -cp "classes:lib/json-simple-1.1.1.jar:lib/junit-4.12.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar" org.junit.runner.JUnitCore trueaccord.AdminToolTest trueaccord.DebtInfoTest trueaccord.DebtTest trueaccord.PaymentPlanTest trueaccord.PaymentTest trueaccord.util.EndpointConsumerTest`

## What I would do if I had more time
- Add more comments
- More thorough testing for null checks, boundary cases, invalid inputs/cases, run scenarios, etc
- Add javadocs, for like constructors, add descriptions, etc i.e. documentation
- Check endpoint API that I'm consuming - make sure all preconditions are true
    i.e. check PaymentPlan really is One-to-one with debt. 
- Optimize some of my data structures
    i.e. things like, tweak arraylist init sizes
- Optimize code
    i.e. shortcircuit paymentplans if they are empty and not call filterPayments
- Rename some things, like DebtInfo, and/or find better readable names
- Add more helper/util methods
- Maybe change in AdminTool the params of some functions, like some of the filters methods, so that the params feels good on the handoff, feels right, feels clean
- Maybe put back filteredPaymentPlans(list), requirement is that there's only one paymentplan, but in future (extensibility) this could change
- Maybe write this in a language that is more JSON friendly. Or if I kept with Java, try out a diff JSON library.
- Change DebtInfo.toString() to use a json formatter

## Assumptions/Problems
### Assumptions
1. endpoint APIs return back ids and startdates in ascending order
2. BI_WEEKLY = twice a month (not twice a week)

### Problems
1. Not sure how you pay .085 of a dollar
```json
[
  {
    "amount_to_pay": 102.5,
    "debt_id": 0,
    "id": 0,
    "installment_amount": 51.25,
    "installment_frequency": "WEEKLY",
    "start_date": "2020-09-28"
  },
  {
    "amount_to_pay": 100,
    "debt_id": 1,
    "id": 1,
    "installment_amount": 25,
    "installment_frequency": "WEEKLY",
    "start_date": "2020-08-01"
  },
  {
    "amount_to_pay": 4920.34,
    "debt_id": 2,
    "id": 2,
    "installment_amount": 1230.085,
    "installment_frequency": "BI_WEEKLY",
    "start_date": "2020-01-01"
  },
  {
    "amount_to_pay": 4312.67,
    "debt_id": 3,
    "id": 3,
    "installment_amount": 1230.085,
    "installment_frequency": "WEEKLY",
    "start_date": "2020-08-01"
  }
]
```
2. Example payloads have different UTC times than the ACTUAL payloads (yyyy-mm-dd)
```json
[{
  "id": 0,
  "debt_id": 0,
  "amount_to_pay": 102.50,
  "installment_frequency": "WEEKLY",
  "installment_amount": 51.25,
  "start_date": "2020-09-28T16:18:30Z"
}]
```
3. Why the actual payment date is way off from interval and start date on payment plan?
``` json
  {
    "amount_to_pay": 4920.34,
    "debt_id": 2,
    "id": 2,
    "installment_amount": 1230.085,
    "installment_frequency": "BI_WEEKLY",
    "start_date": "2020-01-01"
  },
```
```json
  {
    "amount": 4312.67,
    "date": "2020-08-08",
    "payment_plan_id": 2
  },
```
- What to do in this case?
- The doc says "The next payment date can be calculated by using the payment plan start_date, the installment frequency, and any preexisting payments".
- My formula for payoff date: start_date + (installmentFrequency * # of payments)
